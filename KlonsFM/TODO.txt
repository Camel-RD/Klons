CURRENT TASKS
- refresh poga logos Artikuli, Noliktavas
- atgriezts_docs
	- oldprice?
	- set isgone = 0 in makelinks
- rows where buyprice is calculated and sale price should be set to buyprice
	- Atgriezts_piegādātājam, Kredītrēķins_no_piegādātāja, Uz_noliktavu, norakstīts, Izlietots
	- needed for accounting, printing
- rows where buyprice is calculated as last buyprice and sale price should be set to buyprice
	- inner movement, norakstīts
- services
	- can we enable counting of services?
	- doc can have only services and we would use store with type Services
- SQL for makelinks and recakc ckeck use of trackstore and isservice
- For accounting
	- for internal movement
		- per doc or summed up per month
		- mark doc Nav PVN
	- for norakstīts / pierakstīts
		- store must hold 7xxx accountid in 21xx field
		- what about VAT
			- mark doc Nav PVN
			- is there VAT?
			- leave it to accountant
- overview reports
	- calculated cost of sales aggregated per period
		- we are not doing cost accounting per each sale doc
		- accountant uses this report to make/edit entries in OPS
			- or we make fin doc per store doc as configurable option
	- aggregated overview of innre movement, produced good, goods used in production
	- link inspection per item
		- we could do full calc in code and compare with db
			- a lot of work
			- kinda necessary to ensure correct sql
- tools
	- Recalc isgone field
		- auto start on first app start
		- maybe add isgone update logic to fast makelinks sql's
			- not critical because when auto recalc used

BIG UNKNOWNS
- Revaluation of current item stocks
	- no clue how its done
- The same for docs (crredit docs) that change initial doc
- cost accumulation for production or construction
	(per product / project ...)
	- for that we have to make movement of services trackable
	  and use smth like - Nākamo periodu izmaksas
- we are going for one DB for entire company - no local DBs
	- with multiple DBs we cant track stock movement per supplier
		- unless items are linked to single supplier
	- with multiple DBs cost calc with FIFO method is not correct looking at entire company
		- cost is not attributed to different units locatad in different places with own DBs
		  but in virtual FIFO queue
	- or we do separate cost calc for each shop?
		- what do we do with supplier info?
- weighted average buyprice, cost

MAYBE
- doc rows: allow to enter custom item name different from name in Items table
	- additional table for custom item names
	- no need to make seperate items for each name
	- low cost when actually not used
- allow to add/edit custom PVN Režīms
	- or leave it and add new ones when requested - no one does requesting
- add change tracking field and triggers for relevant/all tables
	- to allow client to detect changes and load changed rows
		- how do we detect deleted rows?
			- row deletion expected to be rare
	- good for switching to EF
	- triggers do change tracking field and - designated seq-gen
	- triggers can slow down long running sql's
		- does not matter when we go for EF
	- client requests current value of seq-gen to detect changes
- doc export to xml
- doc nr generator
